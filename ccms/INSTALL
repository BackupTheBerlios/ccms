System requirements:
--------------------
- Linux or bsd (won't work on win)
- Apache
- PHP4
- Perl5
- php_ldap if you use LDAP user management
- php_mysql for mysql users backend
- nothing for flat file user storage

Step by step installation:
--------------------------
# Get the source tarbal
wget http://makina-corpus.org/docs/ccms_0.2b1.tar.gz

# Copy the archive into a directory accessible by your web server
cp ccms_0.2b1.tar.gz /var/www/

# Decompress the archive in your working directory
tar xzvf ccms_0.2b1.tar.gz

# Go into extracted directory and read the most you can
# (README, LICENSE, etc...)
cd ccms_0.2b1

# Launch a web browser on the current directory
# Be sure that your web server can write onto this directory
# (probably need to use 'chown -R www-cata:www-data ccms_0.2b1')
http://localhost/ccms_0.2b1/

# Complete the HTML forms and validate to install the CCMS.
# You may be asked to include some apache directives, that
# sould be done as root.
# If you want an advanced configuration, you can edit some vars
# in index.php

# Read the installer output and restart your web server after including the 
# conf files.

# Then you can point your web browser to the url you have setup in
# config file, and begin to work.
