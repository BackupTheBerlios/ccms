- Adding default pages in several languages

- Ability to add admin users via web interface ?

- real-XML compliant

- using XSLT instead of skins 
 -> means that skins will become XSLT stylesheets

- make template, a special inc/display_search.php can be necessary.
*    the templating system has changed a little, maybe we should have an eye on it.

- make help page modifiable by a web interface (when within template system)
*    too much a good idea !

- make users.php use skin/admin templates as well
*    humm.. i don't really know if it is useful...

- include the javascript editing tricks for rich text made by ramzi in files.
*   still pending. will become urging when we attack the admin part deeper.

- check the cWriter for including functionnal modules in the backoffice for
  the collaborative side of that tool.

- make the files.php menu expandable at wish (suggested by jjh).
  we can use our php session to store that display feature.
*    I found a place where it works like that: nexen php documentation
*    is an expandable menu with cookies. we need that stuff !

- add attributes in users.php for personnal information (phone, email, etc. )
  (best option will be to get a popup window zoom each entry).
ииии project split: LuDAP version 0.1 will manage LDAP entries
*    follow ludap project especially about group implementation,
*    that will involve patching auth.php to fit to new architecture

- insert comments inside the code. I hope Ramzi will be able to help in it.
ииии in progress (not the priority)
*    still a daily duty...

- cron the rotation of step files and set up their storage
*    still to be done ц 03/10/2001:01:11 ц moz ц  

- build another page to display user logs to administrators
*    still to be done ц 03/10/2001:01:11 ц moz ц
